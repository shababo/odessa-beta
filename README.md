                A MATLAB sketch of a simple framework for controlling experiments. The essential object is a sequence of actions in time. Any programmatic way of creating a sequence of actions - including adaptive, closed-loop, or totally predetermined sequences. Action objects, in general, will be split into two classes: io and processing. We want to create a simple core of objects can be extended by users and therefore interface with most hardware or software.  Data related objects include general types that are exchanged with hardware, i.e.  input and output signals, and hardware interfaces like DAQ  and channel objects. 

                From a user's perspective, we want to make it (relatively) easy to orchestrate experiments that require controlling a lot of hardware and/or online analysis. Ideally, we can abstract a protocol as a sequence of nodes, and the user will interface with a node-based gui, i.e. a flow-diagram. As a user, I am expected - at least for now - to understand how to write my own modules. As a library of modules is developed, the software may become easier to use. But for the developer's sake and for hopeful flexibility, we only want to write some abstract classes. The rule of thumb will be to resist writing anything too specific.

                We also want to make sequences nestable. This will allow the composition of novel modules without explicitly coding up a new one. For example,
